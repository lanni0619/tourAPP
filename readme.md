- Separating routers and controllers to keep the codebase organized, maintainable, and scalable.
- In controller, it's only concern about application's implementation:

  - Bridge between model and view layers.
- The model which acutally solves the business problem:

  - Checking if user's password is correct.
  - Validating user input data.
  - Ensuring only users who bought tour can review it.
